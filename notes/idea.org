* Explore the CSC

What would a "simple" site to explore the CSC 2.0 be like?

For now, this is focused on a simple source search (by name or
location) rather than more interesting ideas, like most variable or by
hardness ratio.

- identify location (position and radius)
- find all master sources (list basic properties)
 - select a source, so can get basic obsid properties
   events, psf, exposure map, light curve, spectrum

How do we identify potentially overlapping sources?
